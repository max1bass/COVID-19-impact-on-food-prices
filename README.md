# The purpose of this project is to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food prices in developing countries, focusing on identifying economic and geographical patterns in price changes and their relationship to socioeconomic factors like the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.

Main Features:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Two datasets were used:
1. Developing countries' data: Includes HDI, GNI per capita, and other socioeconomic indicators.
2. Food commodity prices: Includes producer prices of basic food items from 2019 to 2021.
- Data cleaning involved handling missing values, standardizing names, and removing outliers.

Analysis Objectives:

- Investigating the correlation between HDI and GNI per capita.
- Assess the percentage change in food prices pre- and post-pandemic.
- Explore the relationship between HDI and food prices in 2021.
- Map the geographical distribution of COVID-19's impact on food prices.

Statistical Analysis and Visualization:

- Scatter plots, bar plots, and choropleth maps were used to visualize data.
- Linear regression and correlation analyses evaluated relationships between variables.
- Data grouped by HDI tiers to determine varying impacts.

Insights:

- Strong correlation between HDI and GNI per capita.
- Significant negative impact of COVID-19 on food prices in most developing countries.
- No substantial correlation between HDI and 2021 food prices, indicating other influential factors.
- Regional disparities in the percentage change of food prices, with some countries experiencing over 200% increases.

Geographical Mapping:

- The impact of price changes was visualized using a choropleth map for easy identification of regional trends.

This project emphasizes the vulnerability of developing economies to global crises and highlights the necessity for robust data to better understand and address these disparities.
